Simulation of about 3000 particles in a box. Works really well with parameters as in sim6.py (which is the main file).

There are also many additional helper functions that could help analyze the distribution of the balls' in the box. 

sim3 is deprecated

sim6 contains more accurate and less computationally expensive code to simulate many balls' in a box.
